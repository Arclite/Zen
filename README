#Zen

##What is Zen?

Zen is a minimalistic screensaver for Mac OS X. Zen displays only your desktop image, nothing else. Yes, I realize this defeats the purpose of a "screen saver", but it looks neat.

##Accolades

Zen includes the "MGCropExtensions" code by [Matt Gemmell](http://mattgemmell.com/).
